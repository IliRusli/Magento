Magento Task by Ilifilza Rusli

From my understanding, Magento helps to organize the back-end for a website. It’s customizable and easy to navigate. I’ve yet to explore more of its benefits and functionality. Today, I almost complete the tutorial given but not the task, the setup and configuration took more time than I’ve anticipated. I apologize for that. If time permits, I would like to learn and have a better understanding of Magento. Thank you.
